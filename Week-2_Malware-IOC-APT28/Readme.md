# Flask URL Shortener

A basic web-based URL shortener built with Flask and SQLite.

## Features

- Input a long URL and generate a unique 6-character short code.
- Store URL mappings in a SQLite database.
- Redirect users from the short URL to the original long URL.
- Display a fake domain name in the short URL link for better presentation.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install Flask:
3. Run the app:
4. Open your browser and visit:
5. Paste a long URL and get a shortened link.

## Notes

- The displayed short URL uses a fake domain (e.g., `https://surprise.com/abc123`), but the clickable link points to the local Flask server.
- This is a local app and does not host the fake domain online.
