Absolutely, Shreya! I can make a **professional, beginner-friendly README** for your **Network IDS project** to post on GitHub. It will explain your tool, code, usage, and sample PCAPs. Here’s a template you can use:

---

# **Lightweight Network IDS**

A beginner-friendly Python-based **Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** that analyzes network traffic from PCAP files and detects suspicious activity like pings, scans, and high-rate connection attempts.

---

## **Features**

* Detects **ICMP ping requests and replies**
* Detects **TCP connection attempts (SYN packets)**
* Detects **port scans** (SYN, NULL, FIN scans)
* Flags **suspicious high-rate activity** (floods or repeated scans)
* Works with **PCAP files** from Wireshark or NMap captures

---

## **Requirements**

* Python 3.x
* Scapy library

Install Scapy via pip:

```bash
pip install scapy
```

---

## **Files**

* `network_ids.py` → Main Python script for IDS
* `README.md` → This file
* **Sample PCAP files** (optional, download from Wireshark Sample Captures):

  * `nmap_scan_ping.pcap` → ICMP ping detection
  * `nmap_scan_syn.pcap` → SYN scan detection
  * `nmap_scan_null.pcap` → NULL scan detection
  * `nmap_scan_fin.pcap` → FIN scan detection
  * `nmap_zombie_scan.pcap` → Advanced stealth scan

---

## **Usage**

1. Place the PCAP file in the same folder as `network_ids.py`.
2. Open **IDLE** (or your preferred Python environment).
3. Run the script (`F5` in IDLE).
4. When prompted, enter the PCAP file name:

```text
Enter PCAP file path: nmap_scan_syn.pcap
```

5. The script will analyze packets and print alerts:

```text
[TCP] SYN attempt from 192.168.100.101 to 192.168.100.102:80
[ALERT] Possible SYN scan from 192.168.100.101
```

---

## **How It Works**

* Reads packets from the given PCAP file using Scapy.
* Checks each packet for:

  * ICMP → ping requests/replies
  * TCP SYN → connection attempts
  * NULL / FIN → stealth scan attempts
* Tracks repeated activity for high-rate alerts.
* Prints alerts for suspicious or unusual behavior.

---

## **Demo**

You can test the IDS with Wireshark NMap sample captures:

1. `nmap_scan_ping.pcap` → see ICMP alerts
2. `nmap_scan_syn.pcap` → see SYN scan alerts
3. `nmap_scan_null.pcap` → see NULL scan alerts
4. `nmap_scan_fin.pcap` → see FIN scan alerts
5. `nmap_zombie_scan.pcap` → see repeated SYN attempts

---

## **Notes**

* Safe to use on sample PCAPs; **do not replay malicious traffic on live networks**.
* Can be extended to detect more advanced attacks or log alerts to a file.

If you want, I can **also make a GitHub-ready version with badges and headings** so it looks professional on your GitHub page.

Do you want me to do that?
